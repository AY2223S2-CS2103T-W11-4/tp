MediMate (MM) is a cross-platform desktop application for medical professionals, specifically for private doctors or
their receptionists,
who are experienced with computers and currently using paper records to store patient information.
With this solution, they will be able to better manage their patient data, including updating,
accessing and adding new patient details easily. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still
having the
benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MM can get your contact management tasks done faster
than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc. It is optional field, hence it is not required to fill in.
* Parameters can be in any order for **add**, **edit** and **deletes** function only.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* All commands and prefix are case-sensitive. Invalid cases for command or prefix will result in displaying `Unknown command` or `Invalid command format!` respectively.<br>
  e.g. `EDIT 1 ag/50` and `edit 1 AG/50` will not be recognised as a valid command to change the age.
  e.g. The correct format should be `edit 1 n/John Doe` and `edit 1 ag/50`.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Help

Shows a message explaning how to access the help page.

![help message](images/userGuide/help-message.png)

Format: `help`

### Add a patient : `add`

Adds a patient to Medimate through command method:

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [ag/AGE] [m/MEDICAL_CONDITION] [nric/NRIC_NUMBER] [t/TAG]…`

* MANDATORY: You must add the patient's name, phone number, email, and address to successfully add the patient into MediMate.  
* Name allows number as a valid input.
* No special characters is allowed at the start or end of the email `username`. (username@domain.com) 
* No multiple (More than 1) special characters is allowed at the middle of the email username. 
* Allowed special characters are `+` , `_`, `-`, `.` 
e.g. `abc@gmail.com` is allowed 
e.g. `ab.c@gmail.com` is allowed 
e.g. `ab..c@gmail.com` is not allowed
e.g. `abc.@gmail.com` is not allowed 
e.g. `.abc@gmail.com` is not allowed
* You can add any number of tags to the patient's profile by adding "t/" followed by the tag.
* OPTIONAL: You can also add patient's age, medical condition, nric.
* NRIC need to be in the correct format. The first letter must be either 'S', 'T' or 'G' (E.g. S9935010Y)
* NRIC is case-sensitive. Hence, 's' , 't' or 'g' is not allowed for the first letter.
* NRIC is not unique. Hence, please be aware to check your NRIC input before adding to prevent duplicate.
* Age need to be less than or equal to 120 and must be a positive integer.
* To record a patient's other information, add them as additional tags to the patient's profile.
* Invalid prefix (such as `A/` in upper case or `ABC` unknown prefix) will cause MediMate to assume it as the description of the previous prefix

The first example contains strictly required information to identify a patient.

The second example contains more information relevant to that patient.

Examples:

* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 ag/12 m/cough nric/S9935010Y t/criminal` 
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com A/John street, block 123, #01-01` will cause MediMate to assumes that `A/John street, block 123, #01-01` is a part of the email address, causing `add` to fail.
