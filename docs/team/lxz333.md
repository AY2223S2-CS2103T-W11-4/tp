### Project: Medimate

MediMate (MM) is a cross-platform desktop application for medical professionals, specifically for private doctors or their receptionists, who are experienced with computers and currently using paper records to store patient information. With this solution, they will be able to better manage their patient data, including updating, accessing and adding new patient details easily. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MM can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a new patient through a pop-up window.
    * What it does: allows the user to add a new patient by clicking on the add button and input information in corresponding text boxes.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes while dealing with long commands and the app should provide a convenient way to simplify them.
    * Highlights: This enhancement makes a good use of the existing command line version of the adding function and integrates it with the GUI. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing UI.
    * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a new appointment through a pop-up window.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to check availability of the doctor on the selected date through a pop-up window.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to display the detailed information of the selected patient through a split pane on the right hand side of the main window.
